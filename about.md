This is a blog about my Data Science Specialization journey. The [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) is an online specialization program offered by Johns Hopkins University and provided by Coursera. The Specialization consists of 10 courses- along with the Capstone Project Course. I wrote about my experiences in all the courses and listed some of the prominent projects that I have completed throughout the specialization. 

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions.
