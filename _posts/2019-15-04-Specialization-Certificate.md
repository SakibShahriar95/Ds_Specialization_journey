**Certificate for completing the Specialization**

This is the certificate that I received from Johns Hopkins University upon completing the specialization (all 10 courses). I would like to thank Allah the Almighty for making this easy for me and granting me this success. Alhamdulillah.

Thank you Dr. Roger D.Peng, Dr. Jeff Leek and Dr. Brian Caffo for guiding me throughout the specialization. I would also like to thank the community of students who took this specialization for supporting me and supporting each other throughout this journey.
