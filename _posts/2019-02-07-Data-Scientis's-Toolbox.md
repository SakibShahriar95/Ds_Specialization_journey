**Course 1/10 of the Specialization**

This is the first course of the specialization. The course was divided into 4 sections named week1 - week4. Although, the sections itself did not require a week to complete as you will realize.


This course introduces us to the essential's that we need as Data Scientist's such as GitHub. Well, firstly, the course starts by simply showing us how we can install R and R Studio on our computers. Given that the course is structured around R, it was pretty important to get that sorted out. So that was the first section of 4.

In "Week 2", we are introduced to git and github. Now, coming from a CSE/CS background, I should have been pretty familiar with git...But I wasn't (as you could probably tell from my github account). So I'm glad they introduced git and its truly among the essential tool that we need.

The next week is more theoretical. Concepts of what "data" and "big data" are is explained. There is also a lecture on "Experimental Design" which was a bit advanced (to be fair, it did mention this in the start of the video) but gave a good taste of what's to come!

The final section consists of a course project, and probably the easiest assignment in the whole specialization. We needed to basically showcase our git skills and upload something on github. 

Overall, I feel this course was extremely helpful. I would add some other lectures that show what a typical Data Science Project looks like just to give a feel for the subject to the new students.
My Rating: 9.5/10
