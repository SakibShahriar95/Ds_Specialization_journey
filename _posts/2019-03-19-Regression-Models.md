**Course 7/10 of the Specialization**

Regression Models is one of my favorite topics in Data Science. To be honest, my opinion about this course in this specialization might have been affected by another course that I was doing on regression because that course was perfect. 

Week 1 and 2 start off with some background to the subject and also introduces concepts like regression to the mean and linear least squares. Pretty standard. There were some theoretical lectures which were optional. In week 2, the concept of Residuals was introduced and the course project was briefly described. 

Week 3 introduces multivariable regression and it gets kind of confusing. Thanks to some prior knowledge and good browsing, I managed to handle the concepts. Week 4 had Poisson and logistic regression and ended with the course project.

Now about the course project...It was good. Like other projects that I found interesting, this had to do with answering a simple question "Does Automatic cars yield better MPG than manual? " Here is a link to my project report, it's not the most organized report ever! [Does A Manual Car Yield A Better Miles Per Gallon Compared To An Automatic Car?](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera-uploads/peer-review/ddfcec2931e1429eaabf7d44dbb67353/Analysis.html)

Overall, this was an extremely useful course, with a good project. I wish the content was presented differently. For instance, they could have had a small example/case study to explain concepts like logistic regression and so on.
My Rating: 7.9/10
