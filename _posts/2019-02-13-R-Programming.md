**Course 2/10 of the Specialization**

This is the second course of the Data Science specialization. 


This course was all about the R Programming Language. Python and R are by far two most popular programming languages for Data Science and Machine Learning. It appeared that the instructors are quite familiar with R judging by their books and other works, so it was natural that they opted for R over Python (even though Python is more popular and arguably better - aka I'm biased). It was also logical that this was the second course of the specialization as we would definitely require this course for the next ones due to obvious reasons.

In the first section (also called "Week 1"), We were introduced to basic data structures in R such as Lists and Matrices. This was followed by an introduction to "Swirl" which is like an interactive learning tool built for R. Now, I really love the concept of Swirl mainly because it's interactive. Also, it is quite simple to use and shows a percentage progress bar as you go along completing the materials. Its also like a good revision after watching the lectures.

Section 2 introduces control structures of R including if-else and loops. At the end of this section, there is a programming assignment. We were given a dataset and asked to answer some questions. Even though it's supposed to be easy, it was time-consuming and frustrating. I had to do a lot of digging to help me finish this assignment because I was struggling to apply the theoretical stuff learned through the videos to the practical assignment. But, this did prepare me for the other assignments. 

The next week covered loop functions like lapply and debugging in R. There was yet another programming assignment focused on Lexical Scoping and I found this to be boring and frustrating mainly because I did not like R in general, especially coming from a C++ and Java background. So, I guess I can stop here on this.

The final week dealt with generating Random numbers in R. There were a bunch of quizzes and Swirl exercises as usual but yeah I was just happy to get over the line for what was a long and frustrating (but useful) course to deal with.


To summarize my thoughts and feelings, this course could have been done a lot better esp. the programming assignments. But overall, the course itself is pretty useful, particularly when looking at the bigger picture.
My Rating: 8/10
