**Course 4/10 of the Specialization**

"In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods." -Wikipedia

The above Wikipedia definition of exploratory data analysis sums up the course nicely. And I absolutely loved doing this course!

The first section starts with data visualization. We learn about the R base plotting system and the different graphing devices in R. There was a programming assignment after the first week and it was about recreating some graphs using the base plotting system. 

The next section introduced us to more graphing tools including the Lattice System and the popular ggplot2 system. They are both useful tools in R but I really enjoyed working with ggplot2! It gave me so much to work with and the visualization was outstanding. 

In week 3, we were introduced to clustering and dimension reduction techniques. Hierarchical Clustering and K means Clustering was explained, although I would have preferred to have them in a different course altogether. This section also had some lectures about "color" in R plotting. I found this to be some extra content but useful.

The final week contained a couple of case studies. This was the best part of this course. The first case study deals with predicting people's behavior from data collected from their Galaxy S3 phones. It was enjoyable to see the instructor perform some clustering to classify user behaviors. The next case study deals with Air pollution and a dataset from the US Environmental Protection Agency that monitors pollution. This was longer than the other case study but was also fun. The Final Assignment of this course was based on the last case study about air pollution and I enjoyed completing this assignment which had lots of plots and other exploratory analysis skills. 

Overall, exploratory data analysis is one of my favorite courses in the specialization. I learned some great techniques that I can definitely take with me to my work!
My Rating: 9.7/10
