**Course 5/10 of the Specialization**

This course was mainly about how to make sure that your work or analysis is reproducible by others and is not faked by you. This is also a valuable course and has to be one of my favorites in the specialization.

The first section introduces the concept of reproducibility. The instructor mentions that how in science we replicate things but in data science its more of reproducing than replicating. The section then continues with how we should structure our data analysis such as by starting with a question, etc. The best part of this lecture was the fact that the instructor used an example of classifying an email into SPAM or not to demonstrate the process.

The next 2 weeks (sections) introduced the R tools useful for producing reproducible research. In week 2, we learned R Markdown and knitr. These tools are among my favorites when it comes to R. Then in week 3, RPubs was introduced. There was a set of lectures that gave us a checklist to make sure that our data is reproducible. Finally, there were some lectures on Evidence-based Data Analysis and they mainly spoke about what a reproducible analysis is.

The final section introduced Literate or statistical programming, which just reviewed the entire course. The good(great) thing, however, was that there were 2 case studies. First was the air pollution that was introduced in course 4 but this time looked at in a reproducible angle. So we don't really code anything but focus mainly on reading results from the analysis. The next case study was a guest lecture by Professor Keith Baggerly which talks about the infamous Deception at Duke (cancer research performed at Duke University allegedly on fabricated data). 

Before I conclude, let me speak about the course project. This was one of my favorite projects. The idea was to identify the weather events (like a hurricane, tornado, etc) that cause the most health and economic damage in the US. This was the first project in the specialization that felt like solving a real-world problem and it was amazing! I decided to save my work on this project here:  [Wild, Wet, and Wacky](http://rpubs.com/Sakib95/474460)

I really loved this course as it taught me that no matter how good my analysis is, its meaningless if it's not reproducible. I learned about the Duke case which was just mindblowing to know at that time. And most importantly, the project was the best!
My Rating: 9.8/10
