**Course 3/10 of the Specialization**

The title of the course summarizes it very well. The course explains various techniques involved in gathering data, pre-processing it before it can be applied for any analysis.

The first section of the course is about how we can read different data files like excel, XML, JSON. The lectures were great in explaining just that. There is also a swirl exercise and a quiz.

Week 2/Section 2 builds on the first one. Basically gives us more platforms like MYSQL, HDF5 and in general how we can scrap data from the web.

The next section introduces tools by which we can manage the data that we obtained. So, for instance, dplyr was introduced which is a popular package in R. What I most like about this section is, we get to know how we can deal with a dataset when we first get our hands to it. So for example, using the "head" method allows us to view the first few observations from the entire dataset which is extremely useful. Additionally, tools used to split data are extremely handy.

The final week mainly explains the concept of Regular Expression (Regex). To be honest, I kind of skipped over the videos as this was like an optional thing that they added on and specific to the R Language. Finally, there was a programming assignment which required us to clean up some data set, deal with missing values and so on.

Overall, I would say that this course was extremely useful and quite enjoyable. 
My Rating: 9.2/10
