**Course 6/10 of the Specialization**

This course had everything to do with statistics in Data Science. It wasn't a pleasant course to do, lets put it that way. Not because I don't like statistics, but the way the content was delivered was far from ideal.

Week 1 had conditional probability and expected value. Most of the stuff here was just revision for me and I also skipped the swirl exercises.

The next section had variability and distributions like binomial and Poisson. Again, these were quite familiar to me already. 

Week 3 had confidence interval and hypothesis testing. I have covered them recently as part of one of my graduate courses but it was good to strengthen the concept. There were some additional lectures on knitr.

Now the final week was the most tedious as it had lectures on Power, Resampling and Bootstrapping and quite frankly I was a bit lost as to what was going on in this week. This week certainly required more effort but the finishing line was quickly approaching and that kept me motivated.

The course project had 2 parts. The first part was to do with distributions and it asked us to show that the distribution is normal. The second part was more exciting as it was on Inferential Data Analysis. Using hypothesis testing we were asked to investigate tooth growth by different doses. 

So that was this course. Even though I found it uninteresting, I'm sure it is quite fundamental for students, particularly, those who didn't have some statistics background. 
My Rating: 7.3/10
