**Course 9/10 of the Specialization**

This was the penultimate course and the final one before the capstone project. I initially thought that this course itself was a summary of the other courses but was surprised to learn new techniques that deal with building a polished data analysis product. 

They started off by introducing shiny and plotly in the first week. Shiny is a web-app feature of R studio and its pretty cool in presenting results (although painful to deal with). The resources in shiny were plentiful and cover the subject well. GoogleVis - which basically allows R to connect to Google's Visualization API was also introduced in a couple of lectures. Then, there were numerous lectures on plotly, which allows interactive plotting in R and I really liked this tool. 

Week 2 was just a revision of R Markdown, but we did learn leaflet which was amazing. Leaflet is a library in R that allows us to create interactive maps. There was also a mid-course assignment where we were asked to use the tools learned so far. Here is my attempt on the visualization of top 10 cities in the world (Note that due to google coordinates I got the US Cites wrong) [Top 10 cities](http://rpubs.com/Sakib678/476383)

Week 3 was about teaching us how we can build our own R packages and this was very helpful. I wanted to create my own R package on having a top 10 map features like the one I did for assignment (assuming the package didn't exist) but stalled that idea for the time. Week 4 was about how we can create our own swirl exercises, which I'm not sure if I will need in the future but is a good tool to know. The course assignment was to develop a data product (could be simple) that uses the shiny app. I went for the classic Galton's Height Data to build an app that predicts your height based on your parent's height and your gender.

Overall, This course exceeded my expectations by quite some margin! I loved shiny, Leaflet and the assignments were fun to do because we could choose what datasets to use and what to develop.
My Rating: 9.7/10
